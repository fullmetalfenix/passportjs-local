Express project, uses express-generator boilerplate - implements basic / local user login through passport - checks flat file repository / 'database' for user accounts. 
 - stores user info through sessions in an encrypted cookie with HttpOnly flag.
 - Once logged in redirects user to personalized welcome page based on role  ('/welcome')
 - implemented basic protected route. ('/protected') only available if logged in as admin
 - Profile page ('/profile') reads your name once logged in.
